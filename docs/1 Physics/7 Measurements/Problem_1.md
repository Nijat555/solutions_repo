# Problem 1: Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

The acceleration \( g \) due to gravity is a fundamental constant that influences a wide range of physical phenomena. Measuring \( g \) accurately is crucial for:
- Understanding gravitational interactions,
- Designing structures,
- Conducting experiments in physics and engineering.

A classic and elegant method to determine \( g \) involves the oscillation of a simple pendulum. The period \( T \) of a pendulum depends on the gravitational field, and this relationship allows for experimental determination of \( g \).

---

## ðŸ§ª Task

Measure the acceleration \( g \) due to gravity using a pendulum and **analyze the uncertainties** involved in the measurements.

This experiment highlights the importance of:
- Rigorous measurement techniques,
- Statistical uncertainty analysis,
- Scientific reasoning in physics.

---

## ðŸ”§ Procedure

### 1. Materials
- A string (1 or 1.5 meters long).
- A small weight (e.g., bag of coins, key chain).
- Stopwatch or smartphone timer.
- Ruler or measuring tape.

---

### 2. Setup
- Attach the weight to the string and fix the top to a stable support.
- Measure the **length** \( L \) from the suspension point to the center of mass of the weight.
- Estimate the uncertainty:  
\[
\Delta L = \frac{\text{Resolution of Ruler}}{2}
\]

---

### 3. Data Collection
- Displace pendulum slightly (\(< 15^\circ\)) and release.
- Measure time for **10 oscillations** (\( T_{10} \)) â€” repeat 10 times.
- Record all 10 measurements.

Compute:
- Mean time \( \overline{T}_{10} \)
- Standard deviation \( \sigma_T \)
- Uncertainty:  
\[
\Delta T_{10} = \frac{\sigma_T}{\sqrt{n}}, \quad n = 10
\]

---

## ðŸ“Š Calculations

### 1. Calculate the period:

\[
T = \frac{\overline{T}_{10}}{10}, \quad \Delta T = \frac{\Delta T_{10}}{10}
\]

---

### 2. Determine \( g \):

\[
g = \frac{4 \pi^2 L}{T^2}
\]

---

### 3. Propagate Uncertainty:

\[
\Delta g = g \cdot \sqrt{\left( \frac{\Delta L}{L} \right)^2 + \left( 2 \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{T} \right)^2}
\]

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis

### 1. Compare your measured \( g \) with the accepted value:
\[
g_\text{standard} = 9.81 \; \text{m/s}^2
\]

### 2. Discuss:
- Effect of **\( \Delta L \)** on result.
- Impact of timing variability on **\( \Delta T \)**.
- Any assumptions or limitations in the method.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

### 1. Tabulated data in markdown:
- \( L, \Delta L, T_{10} \text{ (10 trials)}, \overline{T}_{10}, \sigma_T, \Delta T \)
- Calculated \( g \) and \( \Delta g \)

### 2. Written analysis:
- Sources of uncertainty.
- How uncertainty propagates.
- Final conclusion comparing your result to the known value.
